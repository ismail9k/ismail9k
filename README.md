Hi, I'm Abdelrahman Ismail (aka ismail9k), a software engineer and technical team lead based in Istanbul. With over a decade of experience in tech, I've built and guided teams to deliver high-impact solutions. I work with diverse technologies including TypeScript, Node.js, Vue.js, React, and GoLang, and have contributed to projects across e-commerce, gaming, and dropshipping industries.

I'm also active in the open-source community, best known for my library, [vue3-carousel](https://vue3-carousel.ismail9k.com/). Passionate about team collaboration, continuous learning, and emerging technologies like decentralized systems, NFTs, and AI, I blend technical expertise with strategic leadership to foster innovation and drive success in every project.
